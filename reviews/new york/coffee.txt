What a heck of a nice guy who respects tradition and eschews the gentrification and cookie-cutter mentality that has practically ruined the Lower East Side. Over a delicious vanilla egg cream, I enjoyed commiserating with Carmine about all the wretched changes that have taken place in NYC over the last decade or so. \n\nThe decor is just fantastic - all sorts of movie and music posters, newspaper clippings, cool old signs, soda bottles, vintage radios, a typewriter, and more. Even the spic and span bathroom in the back is decorated with TLC. I especially loved the Three Stooges photo while I was sitting on the throne. Carmine has great taste in music as well...and of the five egg creams I ordered during my stay, his was the best! I am so glad this classic coffee ship is still in business -- too many authentic and charming businesses have closed due to gentrification and the seemingly bottomless demand for high-end, trendy coffee shops and diners lacking any character.

I highly recommend the sampler platter \u2014 it is like a cold European breakfast. The seating is communal and the space is eclectic and pink. Good for big groups. The seats aren\u2019t comfortable, they all are stools - not for me. \n\nThe brownie is exceptionally so so so bad. It is like a dry, dense, flourless vegan protein bar- I really really didn\u2019t like this. Too much cacao possibly. The menu is probably one of the best brunches in New York City and Brooklyn, but that brownie is horrendously out of place. I can\u2019t express how much of a bad taste this left me with at the end of the meal. \n\nThe drinks were out-of-this world: earl grey chocolate milk with a shot of espresso and Johnny were great. I will be back soon when I definitely will experiment with more of the menu and not have the brownie.", "time": 1539463201}, {"author_name": "Anna Pietrzak", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101671200807420612659/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Jop2MfG-QtU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-hsqxUc60Sa7aEjdrePLMpbJCHM3w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Such a gem.
