In my opinion there's no alternative or rock Club quite like this in New Jersey that I know of... this is my happy place. Upstairs you often have and 80s New Wave night or could be just dance night down the basement you have the Crypt  with darker alternative music/goth in one room and in another room Industrial music real interesting place there's something for everybody. Ladies used to get in for free before 11 p.m. the place pretty much starts to come alive around 11:30 to 12 and is open till 3 a.m. unlike most bars in New Jersey which close at 2.

Despite rushing after work to head here, trying to find parking, running in, we still managed to get there too late: right at 7pm when the show started. They\u2019re very strict at letting people in once it starts so you have to wait for the second act to go in. \n\nWe were bummed to miss it and thought we would just have to waste the first 30 minutes of it and be lost forever. They\u2019re prepared for all the latecomers so they have a room, kind of the size of a movie theatre room, where you can watch it in a big screen and not miss a thing. \n\nOnce we got to our seats, despite them not being the best seats in the house we still had a great time. The seats are comfortable and you have subtitles in at least 5 languages (English, Spanish, German, Italian, french). We had a great time and can\u2019t wait to be back for our next show in March!\n\nIf you\u2019re super confused and stuck on what to wear like I was, you can\u2019t really go wrong with anything. We decided to go with cocktail attire but there were many people dressed formal as well as casual with jeans on. For a nice night out at the opera I definitely think you should go all out and stay classy. Might as well right?", "time": 1541721300}]}, "1 OAK": {"place_id": "ChIJpSIzqrhZwokR1KnVMoVty_g", "reviews": [{"author_name": "Lauren Crites", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109064646563745018764/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sV9taY7TVSU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jUhc9suRsJf9bXxKo5XaSpcy0j8A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "Everything about this club is absolutely terrible.
