You will never meet someone who wants to be there less than the young lady drinking tea who checks IDs a the door, MY GOD. She literally spent 2-3 minutes going through her text messages and apps before deciding to RAISE HER EYES to view my ID, at which point she looked back down at her phone. There were no words exchanged, there was no eye contact, just my adult group of 5 friends waiting for a child to get off her phone, I can't imagine putting the least happy person of an establishment at the front to greet people. Every one of my friends who attended this evening had a story for how rude she was to them, it was extremely awkward. This was around 9-10pm. After ~2 hours we noticed the place was really NOT filling up. It was the same 1-1.5 dozen people inside and to get a drink you had to wait 15-25 minutes in the one line for the one bartender, it just didn't add up. So we grabbed our stuff to leave and we were shocked at what we saw as we left... A bouncer telling people they couldn't come inside for reasons. Maybe private parties had spots reserved? I'm not sure, friends have come on other nights and experienced a packed house. But no, there were more people waiting to get in the bar than there were inside, and it was DEAD inside.

He then took my card again, me thinking he's refunding me. But he instead called security. When security got there, he ended up asking the guy why he took my card, to which he had no answer, and security had to get my card back from him. Even security thought he was an ass.

When the server came after was sat ourselves down, I asked if they had any open bottles to try,  the server immediatelty shot me down saying that they don't allow a taste before buying the wine. This is somewhat of a red flag to me;  these wines were sold both by the glass and the bottle and it wasn't clear why they didn't allow a taste before a $60 bottle. Then when I asked for water, the server dissmissed me and said \" there's water next to the bathroom.\" And then when I asked if I could get separate checks for the bill, he said \"No. Because it's one bottle, you can split the bill three ways but I can't do separate checks.\" My question must have meant something different to him because his answer was what I was asking about.

Dee was fantastic in terms of customer service and experience. I had the greatest of fun on Sat and Sun. It is interesting that no other bar checks IDs except this one on Postal. I respect the law, the door bouncers are doing their job but I am sure they can surely recognize 60 yr olds from 20.and be humble. The other bartenders here are stressed. and poor in service.
