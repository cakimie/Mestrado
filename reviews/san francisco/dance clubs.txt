On the weekends there is usually a $10 cover. There are two main floors. The lounge floor is visible as soon as you get in, and it's pretty nice. There are a good sized bar and plenty of benches and tables for groups to chill in. Downstairs is the dance floor, which is pretty sizable and has a smaller bar. I recommend getting your drinks on the lounge floor.\n\nThe drinks here aren't too pricey. Most drinks range from 8 to 15 bucks, depending on what you get. The bartenders serve pretty strong drinks. The DJ here tends to play mostly hip hop from the 90s and 00s, with some today's music mixed in.\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're going out with a pretty sizable group.

Unfortunately, the Indian, Asian, and Black dancers were just as terrible as the White ones.\n\nAttitude of Dancers (0/10) - They will keep asking if you want a dance until you either get one or leave.

The one girl that I got a dance from did give me a free DVD of herself in some weird pregnant fetish film though, so that was pretty sweet.\n\nValue (0/10) - The cover is good for a few other bars that are owned by the same guy, but if this is how he runs a club, why would anyone think that's a good thing?

There are no dark corners in which to relax and hide from the pushy dancers.\n\nClub Atmosphere (0/10) - They don't serve alcohol and there isn't much stage action, so the only thing to do is talk to the dancers.

I recommend getting your drinks on the lounge floor.\n\nThe drinks here aren't too pricey. Most drinks range from 8 to 15 bucks, depending on what you get. The bartenders serve pretty strong drinks.
