From what the host has mentioned, management who wasn\u2019t even present at the event has provided little follow up regarding her concerns.

Many guests chose to not eat or had to take their meal outside because at least there was a breeze blowing. When we expressed our concerns to the owner, she placed 100% of the blame on my guests and me as the host. She was unwilling to discount our final bill at first and threatened to file a police report if it was not paid in full within 24 hours.

I want to taste coffee, not a sweetener when I drink coffee.", "time": 1540488878}]}, "Insomnia Cookies": {"place_id": "ChIJ4yhdqxHTD4gRER0i1RQiAQM", "reviews": [{"author_name": "Leonard Chen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111501427580511258139/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ho4taLYlQJE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-iz3z4E5H78DAHoZcUbAP9ffaYgNw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I've had insomnia cookies in other places like NYC, but usually not fresh/warm.

A few other good ones are double chocolate chunk and double chocolate mint.

My favorites to get here: Chicken empanadas (make sure to ask for the hot green sauce to go with your empanadas -- no extra charge for this and it is made from scratch. Other goodies: Try the  guava and cheese topped off with a little coconut pastry. These three combinations are layered within the flaky, light pastry. The bottom layer is cheese, guava is in the middle and coconut flakes on top of the guava (which you cannot really see but can taste). This pastry is flaky and light and is usually cut/sliced into small triangles. It's rich but super delicious and goes perfectly with their Colombian cafe con leche (coffee with milk). If you like coconut you must try their coconut bread (they look like chubby biscuits and topped off with coconut shavings). Not overly sweet, but definitely satisfying. If you like anything with guava, try the \"Gloria\" guava pastry. They have them with or without cheese. I prefer without cheese, but both are very good. Have you ever had an Arepa? If not, give it a try -- Arepas are sold with or without cheese. These are not overly sweet and are made with cornmeal. It's an acquired taste, so you may or may not like Arepas, but try it and see! GOOD NEWS: Cash, debit, credit cards are all accepted. The long counter/bar has plenty of stools that fill up quickly on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. My favorite things to get here are: the chicken empanadas with their green spicy sauce with just the right amount of heat, the Gloria filled with Guava, coconut bread (perfect with their Colombian coffee) and the triangle shaped guava, cheese and coconut pastry. This is my very favorite pastry. I also like their guava filled donuts (looks like a donut but is more dense) and dusted off with sugar (not powered sugar). The staff is very friendly and welcoming. My only complaint is they don't always call out numbers (even if you take a number). Yes, they don't always call out numbers, but I am always amazed how the ladies behind the counter always know WHO IS NEXT. There are a few tables towards the front, albeit small, but always a challenge to get a table on a weekend especially the ones near the large glass window. I tend to sit at the bar (tall stools) and enjoy whatever I purchase here. The price-point is excellent. Their baked goods are made fresh every morning. I went here on 11-11-2018 (for the 100th time -- LOL) and was their first customer at 7:05 a.m. I sat in my car for 20-minutes waiting for them to open Sunday morning. I don't live in the area, but it is well worth the drive (for me). I highly recommend you get to this bakery before 9 a.m. (the earlier -- the better)!\n\nTheir baked goods are high quality ingredients. All delicious. Don't be afraid to ask \"what is this called\" or \"what is inside\" (some of their baked goods are stuffed/filled with guava, guava and cheese -- or something else altogether). Also, if you like flan I highly recommend their Flan, which is ethereal. STREET parking ONLY and it is (\"Pay to Park\"). You don't have to \"Pay to Park\" on Sunday (parking is FREE every Sunday).  Mekato's is located across the street from the Chicago Police Department (look for the City of Chicago and USA flags across the street). The bakery owner is very nice, down-to-earth, friendly. My final rating is 4-stars. WHY? They do NOT have a public washroom, parking can be a pain and they don't always call out numbers (even if it is super busy/crowded). If you have to use the washroom you will have to wait until (1) you get home (2) or hit up a fast-food restaurant in the area. If you have a washroom emergency, there's a McDonald's on Foster & Kedzie near North Park University (if you really cannot wait).

All counter surfaces had some type of crumb on it. \nThe servers looked like they need to re-evaluate their life decisions, go back to school and take a couple of social interaction classes. My two year old nephew speaks more clearly than they did. I would chose McDonald's overall quality over this place any day. \nWe waited over an hour for our food. Which surprisingly was not terrible. Only reason why I'm giving them 1 star and not reporting this place to get shut down!\nOverly priced and so unorganized. I had to have them explain and break down to me the chicken scratch of a bill. And to top it all off we were charged a fee for using our CC to pay.\nTo top the entire experience, the front door was locked as we're trying to leave... And the girls just stared blankly at us trying to figurr out how to unlock it. \nAll I ask is to please take my review as constructive criticism. First, because I 100% support Hispanic/family owned businesses. Secondly, because someone in the future will Not be as nice as I am and not complain in front of the entire restaurant.  And lastly, because I'm sure this is your means of living. I do not wish to see anyone fail at their dreams. I too am self-employed, but I aim to provide the best service to my clients. \nI will not return, and will never recommend to anyone.

TL;DR - the cake that we got was delicious, though it wasn't what we ordered.\n\nMy wife and I used Urban Icing for our wedding day. We met with a handful of bakeries, but Urban Icing was by far our favorite. They were so nice, everything we tried was delicious, and they were excited to work with us on our vision that, while specific, isn't outlandish. \n\nWe wanted our sheet cake to have two layers of buttercream, one each of two different flavors, and most other bakeries wanted to do each flavor in its own half of the cake. We explained we didn't want our guests to have to trade pieces of cake to get all the flavors, or feel like they missed out by getting one and not the other. \n\nThe woman we met and signed with, Jen, listened to us and said she'd check with the bakers. She got back to us, and hooray, they could do it! It was edited into the contract that the sheet cake would have two flavors run throughout the whole thing, in addition to the tiered cake that would have three layers.\n\nFast forward to our wedding day, my wife and I start the ceremony by cutting into the tiered cake. It looked absolutely incredible, just how we wanted it, and tasted even better. We do our dances, and guests start receiving the sliced tiered and sheet cake. That's when we see that the sheet cake is exactly how we *didn't* want it, with only one flavor or the other. As small of a thing as it is, it was one of the only moments that I was pulled out of the amazing day we were having.\n\nBut, hey, mistakes happen. I wanted to let Urban Icing know of this so they could take the feedback and improve for future clients. After two separate emails, our new contact at the company (Camille) never got back to us at all: not to explain the mistake, or apologize, or to thank us for letting them know. Camille was fairly unresponsive after we started working with her, but this was (pun absolutely intended) the icing on the cake. \n\nI don't know if I can recommend working with Urban Icing. Again, the tiered cake was spot on, and the sheet cake was good, but it wasn't what we asked for -- in fact, it was explicitly what we said we wanted to avoid. They were great to work with, until they weren't, which was so incredibly disappointing. So I suppose if you don't have a very specific vision of the kind of cake you want, then this is the place for you.", "time": 1541282061}, {"author_name": "Erin Lewellyn", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116986175911592061648/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lkeD5vK-PIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/h3dL-ts1D1w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "We ordered a marbled minion smash cake with chocolate fudge filling for my daughters first birthday.
