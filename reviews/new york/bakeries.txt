What upset me the most was we called honey bee that day to notify them of the two mistakes and left a message with one of the girls about how disappointed we were and to have Jen call me back and a week later I have yet to get a call from anyone.

I'd like to chalk it up to the fact that business has been slow, but that's no reason to be nasty to your customers.  I went in to ask if I could get a cake made and she said they don't do cake orders anymore due to the lack of orders.  Understandable, asked if they could make a pie instead, but she replied that they do not make that type of pie.  Sure, I get it - no problen.  Then, I tried to start up a conversation with her about the traffic in the store (hoping that they weren't closing for good) and trying to offer positive words because I really like it there and her response, with an attitude no less, was, \"So are you going to make a purchase\"..and I said \"no, sorry\" and she rolled her eyes like \"figures\" and said ok and walked away.  I mean sheesh, I understand people have things going on in their lives, but definitely uncalled for.
