All counter surfaces had some type of crumb on it. \nThe servers looked like they need to re-evaluate their life decisions, go back to school and take a couple of social interaction classes. My two year old nephew speaks more clearly than they did. I would chose McDonald's overall quality over this place any day. \nWe waited over an hour for our food. Which surprisingly was not terrible. Only reason why I'm giving them 1 star and not reporting this place to get shut down!\nOverly priced and so unorganized. I had to have them explain and break down to me the chicken scratch of a bill. And to top it all off we were charged a fee for using our CC to pay.\nTo top the entire experience, the front door was locked as we're trying to leave... And the girls just stared blankly at us trying to figurr out how to unlock it. \nAll I ask is to please take my review as constructive criticism. First, because I 100% support Hispanic/family owned businesses. Secondly, because someone in the future will Not be as nice as I am and not complain in front of the entire restaurant.  And lastly, because I'm sure this is your means of living. I do not wish to see anyone fail at their dreams.
