We searched online for a spot that was having a Halloween party with some nice dance music.  We arrived a little early to beat the crowd.  Since it was a Halloween Party I expected a large crowd therefore I didn\u2019t want to take any chances with my card so when I ordered the first round of drinks I paid with my card, signed, and walked away.  Mind you, it\u2019s only around 9pm.  We planned to be there all night.\n\nThe DJ was good but the crowd did get way too thick for the size of the place.\n\nAbout 30 min later, I went back to the SAME BAR that is located in the back of the club.  I stood there for a few minutes and noticed that I was the only person not being served.   Then I asked the guy that was helping the bartender for 3 Heineken\u2019s and he said that he was not working.  Mind you, I watched him for at least three minutes WORK the bar.  Then I turned to the bartender that gave me the first round and he said YOU DON\u2019T TIP.  I said to him how do you know?   We plan to be here all night and I\u2019m using a Corporate card (in which If I was using penny\u2019s it shouldn\u2019t matter).  I tip at the end.  He said well how was he suppose too know.\nFirst of all!! No where in history have I ever heard of a bar, restaurant, etc refusing customers based on a TIP.  Wonder if the owner knows that the bartender is refusing to sell their products because he ASSUMES he will not get a cut.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happened to others.\n\nAt that point I realized that there was no need for me to stay at a bar that will turn down a round of drinks based on a \u2018TIP\u201d Now that\u2019s Petty!!\n\nNeedless to say, I extended my hand to offer a handshake.  During the handshake I told him he should never prejudge nor assume.. Then I gathered my crew and went to this spot that was right next door to the Taco Burrito Palace.  I think it was Big Jim.  The kitchen was closed however the bar was opened.  The service was excellent.  We had a few rounds and listened to some music.  I can assure you that everyone was pleased with their tip AT THE END!!\nI WILL NEVER, EVER go to that PETTY place again!!", "time": 1540963272}, {"author_name": "Meera Lost", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113506335396693338771/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lQ1zb_MucPo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-ilq-Th6pd7EvR1_sWIaZLWLG8ygQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Decided to go here after leaving Roscoes just a block away.

I did not have to wait long for drinks and the received a good recommendation from a male bartender. However at the price of $40 for two single drinks and two shots .... not worth it.

It was the worst club experience I've had ( and I've been to many clubs over the US and in the world) for several reasons being:\n\n1. Beware of the bottle service \"rules\". My friend got a table for us and was inside the club. But the bouncer wouldn't let myself and another friend join the table, saying that all members of the table had to be present at the time of purchase of the bottle. Most ridiculous rule I've heard of, and something that was not communicated to us. We had to grease to get to our own table and were pretty much treated like trash. \n\n2. Speaking of the bouncer, the entire entrance staff is extremely rude. The bouncer gave me attitude, personally cussed me out, told me to \"hurry the **** up\" and more while showing him my ID, all because I told him that I thought the bottle service rule was ridiculous and that we already payed. One of the girls who works the front cussed us out as well while we were walking in because we forgot to get stamps (I admit I wasn't really paying attention because I was still processing what the bouncer said) even after our friend payed extra to let us in after getting bottle service. Bottom line, do not buy bottles here. \n\n3. In general, I just got vibes of a very low place. I was warned by a female friend of mine who said she was assaulted here. I was there this past Saturday and when we left there was of course a fight going on outside. 5 or 6 people, many running through the streets to get away from the police, who arrested at least 1 person. \n\n4. Way too crowded. Getting drinks spilled on you is often the norm, but it felt like a bit too much. \n\n5. One decent thing was they have a cool lighting system. Doesn't mean much though when the music stank. \n\nIn general, maybe a place you try to go to while in college, but definitely not for those entering their mid 20s.

The owner Mary (short older lady with short dark hair) thought it was a good idea to use the 'n' word. It wasn't towards me (I'm black) but was directed towards an older Latin guy she was talking to. When it was brought to her attention that maybe she shouldn't use that word, she tried to weasel her way around it and further attempted to find ways to make using it justifiable, never once apologizing. I feel that as an owner of a public place, you should never make your customers feel uncomfortable or unwelcome unless they are causing problems and negatively affecting your other customers or staff. Either way I am not one who uses racial slurs and I find it absolutely disgusting to hear others use them whether they're towards blacks, Latinos, whites, etc. I will NEVER return to this establishment, it's clear that people of any 'brown' color are NOT welcome.

But, then she divided the class based on skill, with no warning whatsoever and in total contradiction to the class description. Even before this, it was the consensus among the parents that the teacher (Eilleen McNulte) can, at best, be described as brash, cold and unfriendly. Certainly not the sort of warm personality one typically finds teaching dance to preschoolers. After months of classes, she provided 0 feedback or encouragement, and would rarely even offer a smirk. At her worst, she is positively rude, uncaring and nasty. Clearly in it to get your money and not for any love of children or desire to provide them an enriching experience. Save your money and go elsewhere-- this woman honestly has no business interacting with children. I have never had a complaint about any preschool program or teacher, but my awful experience with this woman has compelled me to warn others. She made very derogatory and insulting comments directly to my 4 year old daughter and excluded her from her classmates.
