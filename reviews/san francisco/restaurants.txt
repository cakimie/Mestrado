After scrolling past it on Maps countless times, I finally gave the place a shot. I was expecting a bit more of a traditional experience, but it ended up being way more fusion (or maybe I just mean modern?) than I had expected. I had already snacked a bit throughout the day, so I mainly stuck with the smaller plates. The first thing we had was the takoyaki; this is the one dish that exceeded expectations. Often, the takoyaki's custard-like inside is burning hot, amazingly these were the perfect shape to be eaten immediately (though, maybe that had more to do with the smaller size rather than any intentional decision by the chef). The next I had was a duck yakitori. It had a nice grilled flavor on it, however, there wasn't much in terms of seasoning. I'm used to yakitori having much more sauce, but this felt like I was just eating duck on a stick, which feels like I'm not really paying for much. I wish I had gotten the bacon and enoki skewers instead. The last thing I had was an order of shishito peppers. These also had a a nice chat to them, but also lacked in seasoning. Most of the sauce they had put on the peppers wouldn't stick to the peppers, so it fell to the bottom of the bowl. It would have been better from more reduction to help it thicken up. My last qualm was with the hot sake we were served. Generally hot sake is not actually not; it's usually body temperature. I imagine it's nice to serve it a bit above body temperature so that the sake you pour out cools to body temperature, but what stays in the decanter stays warm. This sake was a bit too hot though. All in all, the food wasn't bad; in fact, I'm pretty sure they have some pretty good stuff there, and I just didn't get lucky ordering. Regardless, this place gave me the impression a lot of these fusion places do: they wanted to appear as if they were elevating a cuisine, but end up not delivering on what they set out to do while serving you less and charging you more. I'm not against \"fancy\" restaurants or something, but when you can't get yakitori to taste great, which most restaurants can, it doesn't inspire me to come back and see if I can guess what on your menu is good. Maybe I'll come back and try to order something that seems more fleshed out.", "time": 1541397727}, {"author_name": "John Tieu", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380643683526470889/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--nBlpUVOPlA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-h7Fmc1BZaQBS0mZx_gdGPZbykGJQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "Good friend service, delicious grilled eats", "time": 1540689327}]}, "Tazaki Sushi": {"place_id": "ChIJfwCq65uHhYARmkkict06u5s", "reviews": [{"author_name": "Bruce Hembacher", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113869808337418458230/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VPILeDj0n58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-iA3tWOd2ZFEhv4FH-YsirmYMsz0A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Great food.

My favorite 3 Michelin star restaurant (as of now). :)\n\nUsually 3 star Michelin restaurants are a once in a lifetime experience that you splurge on and I generally prep myself that it isn't going to be comfort food. Mainly because of the creativity that the chef has to put into his or her food that will earn them that third star. Many 3 Michelin star restaurants (for me at least) tend to be an amazing experience but it wouldn't be the meal id want to have multiple times. Benu has surprised me and is totally different. I would love to go back to Benu again and try more dishes.\n\nEvery dish they served us is an elevated version of some sort of Asian or Western dish but with a twist. The meal starts with quite a few small bites, goes into the appetizers on your menu and then mains and dessert. I'd have to say the small bites really blew my mind. They combined both creativity yet it could also be homey comfort food. For example, we had a chicken wing stuffed with a whole abolone. I could have that everyday. Also the shrimp wrapped in jellyfish. Everything was amazing. \n\nPrice wise, yes it's quite expensive so I'd say I would only come here for special occasions and be ready to splurge. \n\nPresentation of the dishes were beautifully done and service was impeccable. \n\nReally no complaints!

Worth making  the trip at least once and you may find yourself going back if you live nearby or have a long stay. Not easy to get to, you could take public transportation as I did. The BART gets you close, but the bus didn't run that often on Sundays, so a half mile walk slightly be uphill then flat and a slightly rougher part of town. The line was out the door and hour after opening, but the wait from about a dozen from the door to the counter was about 20 minutes as there were 3 people behind the counter. They will do take out, but don't wait too long to eat them.  The pastries we're great! The croissant and morning bun were extremely flaky, crispy, and buttery, with an outstanding chocolate inside. The bread pudding was moist with fresh fruits on top and was good. The chocolate hazelnut tart was very deep and rich. Wanted a loaf of bread, but shipment hadn't arrived yet.  Overall, not easy to get to (take a cab - about $5,  or ride share from BART or Metro Train), but worth the effort!", "time": 1540144763}, {"author_name": "Jeremy Jacobs", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112660257087390255275/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EqGGngpiTGU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOk/z0tbRLUQJmY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Great baked good and pastries set in a hipster environment.
