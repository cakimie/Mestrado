She kinda judged me and my family and assumed that we couldn\u2019t pay it... gave us many weird rules like: you cannot only eat appetizers per person, if you do that one must do this and that. And like there is a limit of charge.... I truly got very mad at her and made us wait an hour for a table that was waiting for us to be seated.  But that was only in the beginning, then she left and after that we had the most amazing time. I don\u2019t even know why I mentioned this but I was really not happy with her attitude towards us.

Presentation was promising. Unfortunately individual main dish ingredients, steak, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, were overpowered by the added sauces, garnish, when they should have been the stars that shined. Passion fruit mojito was excellent, it was served with a regular drinking straw that drew up the muddled mint ruining the experience. These little details matter.
