If you sit for 5 minutes before buying anything they will come find you and tell you that you need to buy something to stay (and no, I am not nor did I appear like a homeless person or poor). But if you go directly to the front desk to buy from them, there's almost never anybody there. You must holler or go hunt them down from their hiding corners in the kitchen behind to get attention.\n\nThat's when things are normal. Recently, I had my car broken into in the parking lot in front of their shop at night while I was inside reading. My laptop and cellphone were all stolen. The total cost to me was around $800-900.\n\nWhen I noticed there were CCTV cameras pointing toward the location of my car, situated right on top of their shop, I approached their workers and manager to ask for a way to review the CCTV footage.\n\nIt was at this time when the two women of Vietnamese descent either out of annoyance or complete lack of care pretended that they don't speak English. They, both the worker and the manager, refused to give me the contact information of the owner of the store nor to help me with the videotape. The manager completely didn't give a damn that I, a paying customer at her shop just 15 minutes ago suffered a tremendous loss on her property. After pressing for over 15 minutes, she finally told me the roundabout time of when the owner of the shop might appear the next day. The woman told me to give her my phone number and contacts and said she will have the owner call me.\n\nOf course, nobody ever called after. When I went back and confronted them, the girl, a server, who appears to be still in high school, gave me a fake number to the manager that I spoke to prior. It wasn't until I asked the ice cream store and the beauty parlor next door in the same plaza that I was able to get the information of the owner of the building.\n\nI hope this is enough info to shed some light on their attitude toward money making and their thoughts toward the customer. You are a cash cow. When you walk in, you are only as good as your wallet. Call me naive, but I do have a problem when a business is this explicit about it...\n\nLAST BITS...IF YOU WANT TO SHOP THERE, BE WARNED, THE THIEF THAT ROBS PEOPLE AND BREAKS INTO CARS COME BY EVERY/EVERY OTHER WEEK TO DO HIS/HER ROUNDS, HIS/HER DUE DILIGENCE. THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE COPS, AND CUSTOMERS IN THE PARKING LOT. THE OWNER OF ONE OF THE SHOPS NEXT DOOR TO BOBO TOLD ME HIS OWN CAR GOT BROKEN IN THE SAME DAY AS ME AND IT COST HIM $1000+ TO FIX. NOBODY GAVE A DAMN.\n\nOh...and one of the bathrooms at Bobo have a door that opens from the kitchen. Even if you lock the door to the outside, the savages in the kitchen can, will, and did, break in while you are inside. Don't expect them to apologize. They won't. No remorse. No wrong done, not sorry at all.\n\nWork work, money money, all happy happy...", "time": 1542352226}, {"author_name": "DENNIS TE", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117180383575528171318/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S0ApxLWLxfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAXo8/muqx2x1loKU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Great place for non alcoholic drinks.
