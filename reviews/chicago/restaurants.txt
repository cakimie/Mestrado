It seems like they're discontinuing the free sauces to encourage people to buy the specialty fries ($7). The size of a full order of fries has also decreased. We used to be able to order 2 full order of fries to split among 4 people, but now everyone pretty much needs their own order. I think this is because they've switched from a full ceramic bowl to a basket with a paper lining.
