These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for
IEEE Access. Use this document as a template if you are
using \LaTeX. Otherwise, use this document as an
instruction set. The electronic file of your paper will be formatted further
at IEEE. Paper titles should be written in uppercase and lowercase letters,
not all uppercase. Avoid writing long formulas with subscripts in the title;
short formulas that identify the elements are fine (e.g., "Nd--Fe--B"). Do
not write ``(Invited)'' in the title. Full names of authors are preferred in
the author field, but are not required. Put a space between authors'
initials. The abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of
what is in your article. In particular, the abstract must be self-contained,
without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of
the full article. The abstract must be between 150--250 words. Be sure that
you adhere to these limits; otherwise, you will need to edit your abstract
accordingly. The abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not
contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material. The abstract
should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will
help readers to find it. It is important to avoid over-repetition of such
phrases as this can result in a page being rejected by search engines.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\PARstart{}{} Urban environments have its own dynamics, made up of a complex network of interactions between people, establishments, and infrastructure. Also, with the growth of technologies such as smartphones devices and Internet access, the amount of data generated in urban areas has increased significantly, providing valuable insights into the behavior of people in these environments. This data can be used to optimize urban services, improve resource management, and enhance the quality of life for residents.

Cities are systems that are constantly changing and evolving. One of the mais characteristics of an urban city is the diversity of establishments and services available to residents and visitors. These establishments, such as restaurants, cafes, and shops, attract people at different times of the day, creating patterns of occupancy that can be observed and analyzed.

Therefore, each city has its own characteristics and behaviors that can be observed along the time, which can be influenced by factors such as culture, climate, and local events. Different cities may have different patterns of occupancy for the same type of establishment, while different establishments may have similar patterns across different cities. These are some examples of how regional characteristics can influence the behavior of time series data and how challenging it can be to model and classify these patterns.

One of the main sources of data in urban environments is the Popular Times dataset from Google, which provides information about the popularity of establishments at different times of the day. This dataset is generated from aggregated and anonymized data from users who have opted to share their location history with Google. The dataset contains information about the popularity of establishments such as restaurants, cafes, and shops, based on the number of visitors at different times of the day.

In the Computer Science field, the study of urban environments is known as Urban Computing. It involves collecting, combining, and analyzing vast and diverse datasets produced by various sources within city environments \cite{zheng2014urban}.

%\textbf{TODO: incluir contribuições do trabalho}

Time Series Classification (TSC) is a subfield of time series analysis that focuses on the classification of time series data. The goal of TSC is to develop algorithms that can accurately classify time series data into different categories based on their temporal patterns. TSC has applications in a wide range of domains, including finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.

To address the challenges of TSC, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms vary in terms of their complexity, performance, and suitability for different types of time series data. Some of the most commonly used algorithms for TSC include Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The performance of these algorithms can vary depending on the characteristics of the time series data and the specific problem being addressed. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of different algorithms on a diverse set of time series datasets to identify the most effective approaches for TSC.

This type of study was conducted by Middlehurst et al. \cite{middlehurst2024bakeoff}, who compared the performance of different TSC algorithms on a set of benchmark datasets. The paper evaluates 18 Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms evaluating a broad range of modern TSC algorithms, including traditional distance-based methods, feature-based approaches, and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. 

From their study, it was possible to select the best algorithms to be appied into the problem of time series classification with a real world dataset, the Popular Times dataset from Google.

Based on the Popular Times dataset extracted and studied by Leonardo \cite{silva2019signatures}, where he extracted the Popular Times data from Google Maps for a set of establishments in different cities and countries, this study aims to continue his contributions by evaluating the performance of different time series classification algorithms on this dataset.
% Explanation of his study
%In their study, the authors structured the time series clustering experiments into three distinct stages. The first stage involved clustering the time series data of businesses within the same category to analyze intra-category behaviors. The second stage focused on clustering the signatures of different categories to explore whether multiple categories exhibit similar behaviors, potentially represented by a single signature. The same criterion used for determining the number of clusters in the first stage was applied here.

%The final stage aimed to identify country-level category signatures by associating similar category behaviors across cities within a country. To ensure representativeness, a category's behavior was considered characteristic of a country only if it was observed in all sampled cities. To achieve this, the number of clusters for country-level category signatures was constrained by the number of clusters found in the city with the fewest clusters for that category. This approach ensured consistency across the sampled cities when identifying representative country-level behaviors.
The authors divided the time series clustering experiments into three stages. First, they clustered time series of businesses within the same category to analyze intra-category behaviors. Second, they clustered signatures of different categories to identify shared behaviors, using the same clustering criteria as the first stage. Finally, they identified country-level category signatures by associating similar behaviors across cities, ensuring a behavior was representative of the country only if observed in all sampled cities. The number of clusters for country signatures was based on the city with the fewest clusters for that category.
% How am I going to continue his contribution? I am going to use his dataset to evaluate the performance of different time series classification algorithms. Also, compare the results based on some metrics. Accuracy,F1-Score, Precision and Recall. Need to explain the metrics and why I choose these.

% Como é o desempenho da classificação do Leonardo em relação a outros classificadores de Time Series? Quais são os classificadores que eu vou utilizar? Por que eu escolhi esses classificadores? O que eu espero encontrar com esses classificadores? Quais são as métricas que eu vou utilizar para avaliar o desempenho dos classificadores? Por que eu escolhi essas métricas? O que eu espero encontrar com essas métricas?
The studies [2] and [3] provided a foundation for addressing several questions. How does Leonardo's work compare to state-of-the-art classifiers? How do existing classifiers perform when applied to a real-world time series dataset? What are the limitations of current classifiers when dealing with such datasets? How do different preprocessing techniques impact the performance of these classifiers?

% Ainda estou escrevendo o corpo da introdução, mas quero fechar a Introdução com algo nesta linha.

In this study, the analysis of the dataset focuses on examining how people visit and interact with these establishments over time. 
By observing patterns of occupancy at different times and types of establishments, the aim is to understand the variations in consumer behavior and how these patterns can be useful in predicting movement in different types of establishments. 
Time series analysis provides a more detailed and accurate view of collective behavior over time, which can be used to predict the occupancy conditions of a location at certain times, optimizing resource management and improving the experience for both customers and establishment owners.

% Based on the time series from the Popular Times dataset, several tests were performed with different classifiers, with the aim of evaluating the predictive capacity of the models and identifying which would be the most effective in capturing the temporal patterns of popularity of establishments. 
% The choice of classifiers was inspired by a recent "bake-off redux" study (Bake off redux: a review and experimental evaluation of recent time series classification algorithms) that compared the performance of different classification approaches on time series datasets.
% “Bake-Off” is a term used in technology to describe a process where multiple technologies or tools are tested against each other to determine the best one. It includes evaluation of various factors such as efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use. 
% These classifiers were tested using the K-fold cross-validation technique, a process in which the data is divided into K parts, and each is used as a test set while the other K-1 parts are used for training, ensuring a robust evaluation of the models.

% In addition, the data was separated by city and country to test how the performance of the models would vary depending on the granularity of the information. This test was important to understand how temporal characteristics can behave differently in a specific city or in a national context. In the tests, the city and country variables were omitted to verify the ability of the models to identify patterns without the influence of this information, which can be useful to assess the robustness of the classifiers in different contexts.

% From these analyses, the results obtained help to better understand how time series of popularity can be modeled and used to generate useful predictions in contexts such as retail and establishment management. The study offers a significant contribution by applying time series models in the area of location and occupancy data analysis, and by exploring the applicability of the classifiers in real time data, such as that provided by Google.

%\subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush
% with the right margin, as in \eqref{eq}. To make your equations more
% compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or appropriate
% exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate
% equations when they are part of a sentence, as in
% \begin{equation}E=mc^2.\label{eq}\end{equation}

% The following 2 equations are used to test 
% your LaTeX compiler's math output. Equation (2) is your LaTeX compiler' output. Equation (3) is an image of what (2) should look like.
% Please make sure that your equation (2) matches (3) in terms of symbols and characters' font style (Ex: italic/roman).

% \begin{align*} \frac{47i+89jk\times 10rym \pm 2npz }{(6XYZ\pi Ku) Aoq \sum _{i=1}^{r} Q(t)} {\int\limits_0^\infty \! f(g)\mathrm{d}x}  \sqrt[3]{\frac{abcdelqh^2}{ (svw) \cos^3\theta }} . \tag{2}\end{align*}

% $\hskip-7pt$\includegraphics[scale=0.52]{equation3.png}

% Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the
% equation appears or immediately following. Italicize symbols ($T$ might refer
% to temperature, but T is the unit tesla). Refer to ``\eqref{eq},'' not ``Eq. \eqref{eq}''
% or ``equation \eqref{eq},'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq}
% is $\ldots$ .''

% \subsection{LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files.

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3.

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

\section{The dataset} % TODO
% Nesta seção é importante descrever o dataset utilizado, como ele foi coletado, quais são as variáveis presentes, e como ele foi tratado para ser utilizado nos experimentos. Basicamente o meu dataset é o Popular Times do Google oriundo do trabalho do Leonardo.
Deepening into the dataset used in this work, the Popular Times dataset from Google was used. This dataset was collected by Leonardo, and it contains information about the popularity of establishments at different times of the day. The popularity of the establishments in Google is also known as Popular Times.

\section{Some Common Mistakes}
The word ``data'' is plural, not singular. The subscript for the
permeability of vacuum $\mu _{0}$ is zero, not a lowercase letter
``o.'' The term for residual magnetization is ``remanence''; the adjective
is ``remanent''; do not write ``remnance'' or ``remnant.'' Use the word
``micrometer'' instead of ``micron.'' A graph within a graph is an
``inset,'' not an ``insert.'' The word ``alternatively'' is preferred to the
word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates). Use
the word ``whereas'' instead of ``while'' (unless you are referring to
simultaneous events). Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean
``approximately'' or ``effectively.'' Do not use the word ``issue'' as a
euphemism for ``problem.'' When compositions are not specified, separate
chemical symbols by en-dashes; for example, ``NiMn'' indicates the
intermetallic compound Ni$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$ whereas
``Ni--Mn'' indicates an alloy of some composition
Ni$_{x}$Mn$_{1-x}$.

Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' (usually a
verb) and ``effect'' (usually a noun), ``complement'' and ``compliment,''
``discreet'' and ``discrete,'' ``principal'' (e.g., ``principal
investigator'') and ``principle'' (e.g., ``principle of measurement''). Do
not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer.''

Prefixes such as ``non,'' ``sub,'' ``micro,'' ``multi,'' and ``ultra'' are
not independent words; they should be joined to the words they modify,
usually without a hyphen. There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin
abbreviation ``\emph{et al.}'' (it is also italicized). The abbreviation ``i.e.,'' means
``that is,'' and the abbreviation ``e.g.,'' means ``for example'' (these
abbreviations are not italicized).

\section{Guidelines for Graphics Preparation and Submission}
\label{sec:guidelines}

\subsection{Types of Graphics}
The following list outlines the different types of graphics published in
IEEE journals. They are categorized based on their construction, and use of
color/shades of gray:

\subsubsection{Color/Grayscale figures}
{Figures that are meant to appear in color, or shades of black/gray. Such
figures may include photographs, illustrations, multicolor graphs, and
flowcharts. For multicolor graphs, please avoid any gray backgrounds or shading, as well as screenshots, instead export the graph from the program used to collect the data.}

\subsubsection{Line Art figures}
{Figures that are composed of only black lines and shapes. These figures
should have no shades or half-tones of gray, only black and white.}

\subsubsection{Author photos}
{Author photographs should be included with the author biographies located at the end of the article underneath References. }

\subsubsection{Tables}
{Data charts which are typically black and white, but sometimes include
color.}

\subsection{Multipart figures}
Figures compiled of more than one sub-figure presented side-by-side, or
stacked. If a multipart figure is made up of multiple figure
types (one part is lineart, and another is grayscale or color) the figure
should meet the stricter guidelines.

\subsection{File Formats For Graphics}\label{formats}
Format and save your graphics using a suitable graphics processing program
that will allow you to create the images as PostScript (.PS), Encapsulated
PostScript (.EPS), Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF), Portable Document
Format (.PDF), Portable Network Graphics (.PNG), or Metapost (.MPS), sizes them, and adjusts
the resolution settings. When
submitting your final paper, your graphics should all be submitted
individually in one of these formats along with the manuscript.

\subsection{Sizing of Graphics}
Most charts, graphs, and tables are one column wide (3.5 inches/88
millimeters/21 picas) or page wide (7.16 inches/181 millimeters/43
picas). The maximum depth a graphic can be is 8.5 inches (216 millimeters/54
picas). When choosing the depth of a graphic, please allow space for a
caption. Figures can be sized between column and page widths if the author
chooses, however it is recommended that figures are not sized less than
column width unless when necessary.

There is currently one publication with column measurements that do not
coincide with those listed above. Proceedings of the IEEE has a column
measurement of 3.25 inches (82.5 millimeters/19.5 picas).

The final printed size of author photographs is exactly
1 inch wide by 1.25 inches tall (25.4 millimeters$\,\times\,$31.75 millimeters/6
picas$\,\times\,$7.5 picas). Author photos printed in editorials measure 1.59 inches
wide by 2 inches tall (40 millimeters$\,\times\,$50 millimeters/9.5 picas$\,\times\,$12
picas).

\subsection{Resolution }
The proper resolution of your figures will depend on the type of figure it
is as defined in the ``Types of Figures'' section. Author photographs,
color, and grayscale figures should be at least 300dpi. Line art, including
tables should be a minimum of 600dpi.

\subsection{Vector Art}
In order to preserve the figures' integrity across multiple computer
platforms, we accept files in the following formats: .EPS/.PDF/.PS. All
fonts must be embedded or text converted to outlines in order to achieve the
best-quality results.

\subsection{Color Space}
The term color space refers to the entire sum of colors that can be
represented within the said medium. For our purposes, the three main color
spaces are Grayscale, RGB (red/green/blue) and CMYK
(cyan/magenta/yellow/black). RGB is generally used with on-screen graphics,
whereas CMYK is used for printing purposes.

All color figures should be generated in RGB or CMYK color space. Grayscale
images should be submitted in Grayscale color space. Line art may be
provided in grayscale OR bitmap colorspace. Note that ``bitmap colorspace''
and ``bitmap file format'' are not the same thing. When bitmap color space
is selected, .TIF/.TIFF/.PNG are the recommended file formats.

\subsection{Accepted Fonts Within Figures}
When preparing your graphics IEEE suggests that you use of one of the
following Open Type fonts: Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, Cambria, and
Symbol. If you are supplying EPS, PS, or PDF files all fonts must be
embedded. Some fonts may only be native to your operating system; without
the fonts embedded, parts of the graphic may be distorted or missing.

A safe option when finalizing your figures is to strip out the fonts before
you save the files, creating ``outline'' type. This converts fonts to
artwork what will appear uniformly on any screen.

\subsection{Using Labels Within Figures}

\subsubsection{Figure Axis labels }
Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than
symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,'' or
``Magnetization M,'' not just ``M.'' Put units in parentheses. Do not label
axes only with units. As in Fig. 1, for example, write ``Magnetization
(A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A$\cdot$m$^{-1}$),'' not just ``A/m.'' Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and
units. For example, write ``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or
``Magnetization (10$^{3}$ A/m).'' Do not write ``Magnetization
(A/m)$\,\times\,$1000'' because the reader would not know whether the top
axis label in Fig. 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be
legible, approximately 8 to 10 point type.

\subsubsection{Subfigure Labels in Multipart Figures and Tables}
Multipart figures should be combined and labeled before final submission.
Labels should appear centered below each subfigure in 8 point Times New
Roman font in the format of (a) (b) (c).

\subsection{File Naming}
Figures (line artwork or photographs) should be named starting with the
first 5 letters of the author's last name. The next characters in the
filename should be the number that represents the sequential
location of this image in your article. For example, in author
``Anderson's'' paper, the first three figures would be named ander1.tif,
ander2.tif, and ander3.ps.

Tables should contain only the body of the table (not the caption) and
should be named similarly to figures, except that `.t' is inserted
in-between the author's name and the table number. For example, author
Anderson's first three tables would be named ander.t1.tif, ander.t2.ps,
ander.t3.eps.

Author photographs should be named using the first five characters of the
pictured author's last name. For example, four author photographs for a
paper may be named: oppen.ps, moshc.tif, chen.eps, and duran.pdf.

If two authors or more have the same last name, their first initial(s) can
be substituted for the fifth, fourth, third$\ldots$ letters of their surname
until the degree where there is differentiation. For example, two authors
Michael and Monica Oppenheimer's photos would be named oppmi.tif, and
oppmo.eps.

\subsection{Referencing a Figure or Table Within Your Paper}
When referencing your figures and tables within your paper, use the
abbreviation ``Fig.'' even at the beginning of a sentence. Figures should be numbered with Arabic Numerals.
Do not abbreviate ``Table.'' Tables should be numbered with Roman Numerals.

\subsection{Submitting Your Graphics}
Figures should be submitted individually, separate from the manuscript in one of the file formats listed above in Section IV-C. Place figure captions below the figures; place table titles above the tables. Please do not include captions as part of the figures, or put them in ‘‘text boxes’’ linked to the figures. Also, do not place borders around the outside of your figures.

\subsection{Color Processing/Printing in IEEE Journals}
All IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters allow an author to publish
color figures on IEEE {\it Xplore}$\circledR$\ at no charge, and automatically
convert them to grayscale for print versions. In most journals, figures and
tables may alternatively be printed in color if an author chooses to do so.
Please note that this service comes at an extra expense to the author. If
you intend to have print color graphics, include a note with your final
paper indicating which figures or tables you would like to be handled that
way, and stating that you are willing to pay the additional fee.

\section{Conclusion}
Although a conclusion may review the  main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A
conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest
applications and extensions.

If you have multiple appendices, use the $\backslash$appendices command below. If you have only one appendix, use
$\backslash$appendix[Appendix Title]

\appendices
\section{\break Footnotes}
Number footnotes separately in superscript numbers.\footnote{It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for
the unnumbered footnote with the receipt date on the first page). Instead,
try to integrate the footnote information into the text.} Place the actual
footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put
footnotes in the reference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes
(see Table \ref{table}).

\section{\break Submitting Your Paper for Review}

\subsection{Final Stage}
When your article is accepted, you can submit the final files, including figures, tables, and photos, per the journal's guidelines through the submission system used to submit the articlle.
 You may use \emph{Zip} for large files, or compress files using \emph{Compress, Pkzip, Stuffit,} or \emph{Gzip.}

Along with other information, you will be asked to select the subject from a
pull-down list. There are various steps to the
submission process; you must complete all steps for a complete submission.
At the end of each step you must click ``Save and Continue''; just uploading
the paper is not sufficient. After the last step, you should see a
confirmation that the submission is complete. You should also receive an
e-mail confirmation. For inquiries regarding the submission of your article, please contact ieeeaccess@ieee.org.

The manuscript should be prepared in a double column, single-spaced format using a required IEEE Access template.
A Word or LaTeX file and a PDF file are both required upon submission in the IEEE Author Portal.

\subsection{Final Stage Using IEEE Author Portal}
Upon acceptance, you will receive an email with specific instructions

Designate the author who submitted the manuscript on
IEEE Author Portal as the ``corresponding author.'' This is the only
author to whom proofs of the paper will be sent.

\subsection{Copyright Form}
Authors must submit an electronic IEEE Copyright Form (eCF) upon submitting
their final manuscript files. You can access the eCF system through your
manuscript submission system or through the Author Gateway. You are
responsible for obtaining any necessary approvals and/or security
clearances. For additional information on intellectual property rights,
visit the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights department web page at
\underline{http://www.ieee.org/publications\_standards/publications/}\break\underline{rights/index.html}.

\section{\break IEEE Publishing Policy}
The general IEEE policy requires that authors should only submit original
work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor is under
review for another refereed publication. The submitting author must disclose
all prior publication(s) and current submissions when submitting a
manuscript. Do not publish ``preliminary'' data or results. To avoid any delays in
publication, please be sure to follow these instructions.  Final
submissions should include source files of your accepted manuscript, high
quality graphic files, and a formatted pdf file. If you have any questions
regarding the final submission process, please contact the administrative
contact for the journal.
author is responsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any
consent required from employers or sponsors before submitting an article.

The IEEE Access Editorial Office does not publish conference
records or proceedings, but can publish articles related to conferences that
have undergone rigorous peer review. Minimally, two reviews are required for
every article submitted for peer review.

\section{\break Publication Principles}
Authors should consider the following points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work.
\item The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. For example, an obvious extension of previously published work might not be appropriate for publication or might be adequately treated in just a few pages.
\item Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported.
\item Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and
use the reported results. Although not everything need be disclosed, a paper
must contain new, useable, and fully described information. For example, a
specimen's chemical composition need not be reported if the main purpose of
a paper is to introduce a new measurement technique. Authors should expect
to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate
data and critical details.
\item Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievement, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Acknowledgment}
The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is
without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Use the singular heading even if you have
many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would
like to thank $\ldots$ .'' Instead, write ``F. A. Author thanks $\ldots$ .'' In most
cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the
unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.
