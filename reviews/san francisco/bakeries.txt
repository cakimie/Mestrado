He was visiting from out of town so it was a very important occasion. The bakery and I came to a mutual agreement to have it picked up on Saturday, the day of the birthday. I knew they had other obligations so was diligent in keeping the bakery posted with updates on logistics-- my other friend was scheduled to pick up the cake, as I was entertaining the birthday friend. \n\nWhen my friend was delayed with traffic I let the baker know. They threatened to leave so I told them I would come personally pick up the cake. I had to drop everything that I was doing, ruin the surprise and head over with the birthday friend to pick up the cake. It only took me 5 minutes from speaking with the company to arrive at their door, only to discover that everyone at the bakery had left! I was distraught. I tried calling the same number that the baker had used to reach me, only to be completely ignored. I had to reveal the ruined plans to my best friend, completely embarrassing me and casting a depressing mood over the birthday. We are getting older, and there would be little more opportunities for all of us that were gathered there to spend quality time with each other.\n\nI reached out to this company over email, pleading with them to at least let me get the cake the next day or come to some other reasonable solution. It took many back and forths before they responded with a SHAME ON YOU and told me they refund the cost. That was over a month ago. I followed up politely twice and have received zero responses. I understand the stress of a small institution but this complete lack of customer empathy and misleading customer service is truly appalling.
